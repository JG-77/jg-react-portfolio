## Description

---

My new and improved portfolio now features the use of React.js to implement a better portfolio for my professional use. Learning how to structure a React app with CSS and HTML has helped me improve my front-end skills and improve on my coding from the beginning of the course. This portfolio features an 'About Me', a project portfolio, a contact form, and resume section. Using vanilla CSS a clean and polished UI is integrated to offer a pleasing aesthetic for anyone who views my portfolio. I hope page visitors can enjoy my work and will be interested to network.

## Technologies

---

### React.js

- Set up `src` folder that includes files necessary to build portfolio
- Features images, CSS styling, and resume assets folder
- Components folder contains code for HTML element structure and styling along with simple page logic

### HTML & CSS

- Main page elements are the header, navbar, content, and footer sections
- The four content components are the About, Contact, Portfolio, and Resume content
- A mix of inline and external CSS styling is accomplished to set up page elements
- Vanilla CSS styling is used without addition styling frameworks
